# EdTech Island — Project Guidelines & Governance

> **PRIMARY GOVERNANCE:** All agents must read and strictly obey [`EDTECH_ISLAND_AI_ENGINEERING_CONSTITUTION.md`](./EDTECH_ISLAND_AI_ENGINEERING_CONSTITUTION.md) and [`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).

## 🚫 Git Push Policy (STRICT & PERMANENT)
- **NEVER** run `git push` or push changes to GitHub or any remote repository automatically.
- **ONLY** run `git push` if the user explicitly instructs you to push with a direct command (e.g., *"push to github"*, *"git push"*, *"push changes"*).
- All changes must remain local (building, testing, local server running, and optional local commits) until explicit user permission is granted.

## 🛠️ Ponytail Coding Discipline & Engineering Standards
- **Zero-waste architecture:** Do not invent new packages, utilities, or abstractions when standard browser APIs (`BroadcastChannel`, `ResizeObserver`, standard Web APIs) or existing helpers exist.
- **Understand & Inspect First:** Read surrounding implementation and find callers before making any edits.
- **Minimal Reversible Change:** Make the smallest, cleanest change that solves the issue without touching unrelated files.
- **No Unsolicited Architecture Refactors:** Never migrate frameworks, rewrite working legacy code, or restructure folders without explicit authorization.

## 🔒 Platform Invariants & Rules
- **Rule 0.1 — DO NOT GUESS:** Never invent files, database tables, API routes, or analytics formulas. If unverified, stop and ask.
- **Single AI Bot Singleton:** Maintain strictly one Aria AI widget per page session with deep `iframe` / route inspection (`getScreenContent()`).
- **Evidence & Analytics Pipeline:** Historical telemetry is immutable; never mutate raw analytics events or change versioned mastery formulas without explicit approval.
- **Verification Gate:** Always verify builds (`npm run build:study-island`, `npm run build:student`) and live endpoints before reporting completion. Never claim success without verification.
